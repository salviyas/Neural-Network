# Project Description: Classification of Digits (0-9) from Images using a Neural Network
This project aims to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from images using a neural network model built with TensorFlow. The dataset used is the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. The goal is to train a neural network to accurately predict the digits from the images.

# Steps Involved:
Data Loading: We use the tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data() method to load the MNIST dataset. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

train_images: Images for training the model.
train_labels: Corresponding labels (digits) for the training images.
test_images: Images used for testing the trained model.
test_labels: Corresponding labels for the test images.
Data Preprocessing:

Normalize the images by dividing pixel values by 255, so that each pixel is between 0 and 1. This step helps in faster convergence during training.
Reshape the images to fit the input shape required by the neural network model.
Building the Neural Network:

A simple feedforward neural network (fully connected layers) will be built using Keras.
The input layer takes 28x28 pixel images (flattened into a 1D array).
Hidden layers will be used to learn complex patterns, followed by an output layer of 10 neurons (one for each digit from 0 to 9).
A softmax activation function is used in the output layer to output probabilities for each class (digit).
Model Compilation:

The model will be compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function, suitable for multi-class classification.
Training the Model:

The model will be trained on the training data, and the validation accuracy will be monitored using the test data.
The number of epochs can be adjusted based on the model's performance.
Evaluation:

Once trained, the model will be evaluated on the test dataset to check its accuracy in classifying unseen data.
Visualization:

We will plot the results by displaying a few test images and their predicted labels.
